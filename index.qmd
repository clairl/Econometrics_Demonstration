We would like to learnb about econometrics. The best starting point is simple linear regression, which takes the form of:

$$Y=\beta_0+\beta_1X+\epsilon,$$

where $Y$ is the dependent variable, $X$ is the independent variable, $\epsilon$ is the error term, and $\beta_i$ $i=0,1$ is the parameter of interest.
